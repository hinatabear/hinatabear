yo im hinata and i do every possible nerdy hobby (that dosent involve highschool math on a daily basis), new to coding, learning python, i also do photography and more computer stuff.
I am also very much into keyboards. I also fit the asian coder stereotype perfectly, but you cant blame me, my dad is an IT and i decided at the ripe age of 6 that I wanted to be like him and torture myself with code. I work alone and i only use github to save my history so i dont get accused of using AI from my teacher. my starsign is: doomscrolling daily on reddit
if that says anything about me.
